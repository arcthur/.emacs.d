## Setup

A lovely set of emacs setting. It depends emacs 24.2 on the Mac OS 10.8.

To grab all the dependencies, either:

    git clone git://github.com/arcthur/.emacs.d.git
    cd .emacs.d
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

## Install emacs on mac

I use Cocoa Emacs, installed like this:

    brew install emacs --cocoa

You can also get the very latest Emacs:

    brew install emacs --cocoa --use-git-head --HEAD

## Yasnippet

I use own yasnippet snippet, update in .emacs.d:

    git submodule foreach git pull origin master
